# DeepFace Hands on practice

Deepface is a lightweight **face recognition** and **facial attribute analysis** (age, gender, emotion and race) framework for python. It is a hybrid face recognition framework wrapping state-of-the-art models: VGG-Face, Google FaceNet, OpenFace, Facebook DeepFace, DeepID, ArcFace, Dlib and SFace.
